Instead of directly using `calc(50% - 10px)`, use `max(0, calc(50% - 10px))`. This ensures that the calculated width is never negative, and will always be at least 0. This approach uses the `max()` function to return either the calculated value or 0, whichever is larger.  This prevents potential layout problems that could arise from negative widths.
Alternatively, use a more robust approach that considers different scenarios. For example, avoid using `calc()` when the calculation might produce a negative value. Instead, use media queries or conditional CSS to provide different styles depending on the parent container's size.
