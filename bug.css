The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when using percentage values within the calculation.  For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not render correctly, particularly when the parent container's width is less than 20px.  The issue stems from how `calc()` handles negative values and the context of percentage calculations.
